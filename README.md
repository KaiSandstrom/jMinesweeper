# jMinesweeper
A re-creation of the old WIndows Minesweeper, written in Java                  .

At this current stage, jMinesweeper is text-based in the terminal. 
Classes representing the Game state, board, and individual cells have been
written, and the temporary main method in Game.java uses a simple command line
interface to get user input, and displays a crude text-based representation of
the game board. I will eventually update jMinesweeper to use a full GUI.
